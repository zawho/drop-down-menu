A module for implementing drop down menus.

The createMenu function generates a basic menu with a 5 options and no styles. The styleMenu function adds basic CSS.

If you want to create your own menus entirely from scratch and use only the dropdown function, the setMenuEvent function allows for that.

When creating your own menus for use with this module, be sure to implement the correct HTML classes, namely "dropdown-menu" for the menu parent div, and "dropdown-option" for the menu option children divs.
